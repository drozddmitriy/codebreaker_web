  game_rules_1: "Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The codemaker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6."
  game_rules_2: "The codebreaker gets some number of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The codemaker then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces."
  game_rules_3: "A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the
    numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example:
    Secret number - 1234
    Input number - 6264
    Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)"
  game_rules_4: "A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the
    numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example:
    Secret number - 1234
    Input number - 6462
    Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)"
  game_rules_5: "An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret number."
  game_rules_6: "If codebreaker inputs the exact number as a secret number - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses."
  game_rules_7: "Codebreaker also has some number of hints(depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code."
